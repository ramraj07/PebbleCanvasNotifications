# PebbleCanvasNotifications
### An android app designed to use the "Pebble Canvas" app's plugin capabilities to push notifications to pebble


A plugin for Canvas for Pebble ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas ) that allows the display of notifications from your Android device on watchfaces created using the Canvas for Pebble app. 

** PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THIS APP IS CHECKED UNDER THE "ACCESSIBILITY SERVICES" SETTIING **

The app uses the accessibility service to read all notifications, filter them according to user-changeable preferences, then sends it to the Canvas for Pebble app along with the icon of the sender application.

This plugin requires Canvas for Pebble and Pebble apps to be installed, and the use of the Pebble Smartwatch. Once the plugin is installed on top of these required apps, a "Pebble Canvas Notifications" option appears after choosing the "Plugin" type for a new layer in Canvas.
